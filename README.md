Background:

- Initially wanted to make a responsive app, but struggled with component layouts and took too much time, so used a digital planner made before as a foundation.
- Among monthly, weekly, and daily pages in the planner, found the daily page with a to-do list to be useful for a momentum app. Wanted to make it so that users could use it every day when they connect to the internet, so considered necessary elements.
- The digital planner was made with the intention of starting a business and was based on layouts tailored to personal preferences after comparing it with other digital planners.
- Compared various other digital planners, purchasing 10 of them, and promoting the planners' creators through TikTok, YouTube, websites, searching their names on Google, etc. Compared planners ranging from cheap ($20) to expensive ($35).These are the considerations I was focusing on:

  Why do people buy them? ⇒ The author's personality and spirituality.

  Why do people like and react to planner videos? ⇒ They are pretty, the layouts are well-done, and the backgrounds (scenery outside the window) are beautiful.

  What does the owner want to convey in a short 5-second video? 

Layout:

- The main focus & theme: Concentrating on what you want to see ⇒ achieving the user's goals ⇒ completing daily tasks or to-do lists

⇒ Left: Time, Right: To-do list

Issues:

- Unable to implement drag & drop for tasks in the to-do list.
- Submitted and fixed the to-do list part, but need to implement selecting tags.
- Originally deleted random background images, but some of them were 4000 pixels, causing the diary to feel like it was zoomed out on the screen.

Challenges/struggles 

- The greeting part worked on Tuesday but disappeared the next day without an input box. I watched Nico's lectures again and typed the same code, but it didn't work. So copied and pasted the greeting part from Nico's GitHub.
- Only worked on the greeting part on Wednesday and Thursday, but it worked on Thursday night. Still it's still a mystery why it didn't work before.
